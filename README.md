# MultiScoreboard Minecraft Mod

This Minecraft Fabric mod allows you to view multiple scoreboards
on the sidebar at the same time!

## Usage

To do this, simply call
`/scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar <objective>` multiple
times with different objectives. Calling the same command again
will remove the objective from the sidebar again.

`/scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar` still clears the sidebar.

## On Servers

I can't guarantee right now that Scoreboards on servers, where other
mods change the scoreboard, will still work like in Vanilla.

For the mod to work, it must be installed on both the client and the server.

## License

This mod is available under the CC0 license.
